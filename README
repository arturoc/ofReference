This is a reference for openFrameworks.

We're using github flavored markdown to keep things simple. For reference I'm running the python markdown found here:

http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/

with the headerid extension enabled. You can run that like so:

```py
markdown -x headerid foo.markdown foo.htm
```

You can add cpp to the markup like so:

```cpp
something
```
